Easiest: thinking of the concept
Hardest: implementing it - I was overthinking dynamic spawning
</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
It kind of resembles space invaders.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You play as a doggo named Pepper! There's a chicken above you and it's throwin' out bones and chocolates! Dodge the chocolates and grab the bones!!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Non sequitur
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: keyboard
Randomness: a lot of randomness
Play styles: achiever
Genre: side-scroller
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Multiple sprite spawning and sprite collision
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Tomfoolery!
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Use the arrow keys to move!
Dodge the chocolates; they kill dogs!
Run into the bones!
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players would be wise to keep their eyes on the chicken and even tail it as items spawn from the chicken.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game is pretty abstract. There is no real story or character development in any sense. It's however you interpret a chicken laying bones and chocolates that a dog has to intercept or avoid. 
Mayhaps you see the chicken as a villain, but is it really? There is no one story, and player perspective is key to the narrative of this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Casual players that want to play an easy to pick up and put down game to kill time.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
There is no (winning) end game, so it can be as long/short as you want.
</li>
