<h2>"Bearly" Iced!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?

You play as a smart lad who has developed an ice gun and wishes to test it in a simulated environment.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?

The movement is done via a grid. It's not something you see often in games.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?

Easiest: thinking of the concept
Hardest: making the bears chase the player on the grid
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Kind of similar to old Pacman - movement wise
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Shoot the bears, and don't get hit!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Non sequitur
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: keyboard
Randomness: mixed
Play styles: achiever
Genre: shooter
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Grid-fixed movement
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Shenanigans!
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Use the arrow keys to move!
Press A to shoot left!
Press D to shoot right!
Shoot the bears, don't let them get near you!
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Bears spawn in the four corners of the map. Players would do well to stay away from corners.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
You play as a young genius that has developed an ice gun. To test the combat ability of such a weapon, you enter a simulated environment with giant bears as enemies.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Casual players that want to play an easy to pick up and put down game to kill time.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
There is no (winning) end game, so it can be as long/short as you want.
</li>
