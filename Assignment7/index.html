<h2>Click Clack, I'm in! (Updated)</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Update:</strong></br>
Added more fluid keyboard input functionality: user is no longer restricted to slow, deliberate key inputs.</br>
Added difficulty scaling: enemies speed up linearly every minute, up to a maximum of 5 minutes. Enemy spawn rate increases after 3 minutes.

<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?

You play as an esteemed hacker who's hacking deep in the darkest part of the dark web, careful not to get compromised!
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?

Easiest: thinking of the concept
Hardest: couldn't find a way to record user input like most game engines have, so I had to make an input bind for every keyboard letter
